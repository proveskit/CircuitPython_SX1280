# CircuitPython_SX1280
CircuitPython driver for the Semtech SX1280 LoRa chip (2.4 GHz)

## ðŸš§ Under construction. Use at your own risk!

### Status:
- [x] init and configure
- [x] confirm Tx - [see example_tx](example_tx.py)
- [x] confirm Rx
- [x] exchange packet(s)
- [x] confirm ranging
- [ ] make library user friendly

NOTE: only LoRa aspects implemented thus far. lots of things are hard-coded in. Nearly all LoRa functionality is available (Tx, Rx, Ranging), but message buffer handling isn't streamlined yet.
